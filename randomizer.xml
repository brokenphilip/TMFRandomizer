		Specifies the selection mode for the list of searches:
		
		0 (default) - Treated as an ordered playlist, going from top to bottom - once the list is complete, it starts from the beginning again
		1 - Treated as a shuffled playlist, with no repeats - once the list is complete, it gets re-shuffled
		2 - Same as 1, but the playlist does not get re-shuffled once complete - it maintains its originally shuffled order
		3 - Completely randomized each time, allowing the possibility to get the same search multiple times as dictated by <max_repeats> below
		
		The <search> tag <weight> does not apply to mode 0.

	<!--
		Specifically for mode 3, dictates the maximum amount of times a search can be repeated.
		
		A positive value (X > 0) means that a search can be repeated up to X times in a row before it is excluded from the next pick.
		
		A value of zero (X = 0) means that a search can NOT be repeated, and a different one must be chosen each time.
		
		A negative value (X < 0) means that a search has to be skipped an addtional -X times.
		As an example, for X = -2, there must be at least 3 different searches inbetween two identical search picks.

		In case there are not enough searches from the list to satisfy the requirements of <max_repeats>, the minimum possible value is chosen:
		- If there is only 1 search, max_repeats is essentially infinite
		- If there are only 2 searches, the minimum value is 0
		- If there are only 3 searches, the minimum value is -1
		- If there are only 4 searches, the minimum value is -2
		- Etc...
