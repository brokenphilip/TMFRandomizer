	The following is a list of searches which Randomizer will use to search for tracks.
	
	Each <search> contains the following tags:
	
	1. <exchange> can be tmuf (for United Forever), tmnf (for Nations Forever), tmo (for Original), tms (for Sunrise) and tmn (for Nations ESWC)
	2. <weight> is a positive number (X > 0) used in modes 1, 2 and 3 which dictates that this search is X times as likely to be picked
	3. <params> contains a list of input parameters to be used for the search (ignoring "count"): https://api2.mania.exchange/Method/Index/43
	
	The following list of searches dictates:
