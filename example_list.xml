	The following is a list of searches which Randomizer will use to search for tracks. Each <search> contains the following tags:
	
	1. <exchange> can be tmuf (for United Forever), tmnf (for Nations Forever), tmo (for Original), tms (for Sunrise) and tmn (for Nations ESWC)
	2. <weight> is a number that affects the likeliness of a search to be picked:
		- In mode 0, <weight> is the amount of times (in a row) that the search will be picked
		- In modes 1 to 3, <weight> is the amount of entries (not necessarily, but can be, in a row) the search has in the list
		- In all modes, searches with a weight of 0 (or below) will be ignored completely
	3. <params> contains a list of input parameters to be used for the search (ignoring "count"): https://api2.mania.exchange/Method/Index/43
	
	The following list of searches dictates:
	- 60% chance to get a normal (Race) Stadium track from the Nations Forever exchange which has an author time below 2 minutes
	- 20% chance to get a Platform Snow track from the Original exchange which has an author time below 1 minute and is in Platform mode
	- 20% chance to get a normal (Race) Coast track which has an author time between 15 and 45 seconds
	
	Searches that are not properly formatted and/or do not return any results will be ignored from this list.
